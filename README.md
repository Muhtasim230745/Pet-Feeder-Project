# Pet-Feeder-Project
Project Overview

This project presents the design of a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder system for a local animal shelter. The feeder is intended to:

Dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times.

Monitor food consumption through sensors.

Send alerts if issues occur (e.g., food not dispensed, pet not eating).


The solution has been developed by applying the Integrated Problem-Solving Process taught in class.

Part 1: Problem-Solving Process

Step 1: Problem Analysis

Features required: automated feeding, monitoring food levels, alerts for errors.

Inputs/Outputs:

Inputs: feeding times, food-level sensor, bowl weight sensor, real-time clock.

Outputs: motor control (dispense food), alert messages, logs.


Assumptions: system runs on limited hardware, single type of pet food, scheduled feeding twice per day.

Deliverable: Problem statement, assumptions, block diagram.


Step 2: Data Description

Created a data table listing:

Input types (e.g., sensors, time).

Expected outputs (motor action, alerts).

Sample values and operational constraints.


Step 3: Algorithm Design

Developed a flowchart (via Draw.io) representing:

Feeding logic.

Error detection (e.g., pet not eating, food bin empty).

Alerts and fallback actions.


Step 4: Word Code (Implementation)

Translated the flowchart into plain-English pseudocode, structured as modular tasks with meaningful variable names and explanations.

Step 5: Testing and Refinement

Tested scenarios:

Normal feeding (pet eats).

Pet does not eat.

Food bin empty.
Refined logic and suggested improvements (e.g., adding backup alert channels).

Part 3: AI Agent Integration

AI agent (e.g., Microsoft Copilot) was used to:

1. Refine Word Code – Suggested improvements in task order and clarity.


2. Enhance Documentation – Assisted in creating a professional README.
